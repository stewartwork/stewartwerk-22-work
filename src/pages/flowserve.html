            <p>This project was a partnership with The Creative Momentum and Market Bridge. I was tasked with developing the HTML wireframes, supplying art direction and the interface design. The client came in with new branding half way through the process so we had to re-work most of the design in the middle of the project. The project is in the final stages of development right now.</p>
